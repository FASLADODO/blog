Github Dekstop is easy to hand on, but sometimes commands are more powerful and robost, *like as personal view, github desktop would easily crash while add a repository with large scale files, while commands can fix that*.

# summary
Table 1 - Most Basic
1. ```      git init      ```,                  
2. ```       git add FILENAME         ```,              
3. ```       git commit -m "MESSAGE"      ```,              
4. ```      git push     ```, setup remote repo before make the push,               
5. ```      git pull     ```, update local repo with the remote, often work in ARC.             

Table 2 - Step Further
1. ```      cd .\.git     ``` to look into sepecific setting or files,
2. ```      git config list       ```
3. ```      git status        ```
4. ```      git branch        ```
    * ```       git branch checkout BRANCHNAME        ```
    * ```       git branch merge BRANCHNAME       ```
    * ```       git branch -a      ```
5. ``` git stash```

# multiple account setup
Though there are professional ways to setup by editing scripites, I prefer the easier way - using account A with **Github Desktop**, while using account B with **Git Kraken Desktop**.
