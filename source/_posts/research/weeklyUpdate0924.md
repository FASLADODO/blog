# Cognitive Radar
* fix ```mcc```, set up resouce request line to cut computation half down.
* Ongoing, train ```dpg``` and ```ac```, fix ```dpgDuel``` and ```dpgPri``` compile bugs.

# DQN-DSA
* fixed, upgrade to Python3.5 to run on ARC pbs(although it is more preferrable to running on virtual environment by conda).
